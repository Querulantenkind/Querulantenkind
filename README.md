## About Me

```text
Distro:       NixOS (reproducible ricing is the endgame)
WM:           Hyprland | i3wm | Niri
Passion:      Linux Ricing & endless config tweaking
Philosophy:   The perfect rice is always one commit away
```

I'm a **Linux ricer** who spends more time configuring than actually using the system - and I love every second of it. After years of distro-hopping and countless hours tweaking configs, **NixOS** became my home: declarative configs mean my rice is always reproducible and version-controlled.

## Knowledge Management

<p align="center">

  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Zettelkasten-2E3440?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white" />
</p>

I'm a dedicated **Obsidian** user and follow the **Zettelkasten** method for personal knowledge management. My vault is where ideas connect, notes evolve, and learning becomes permanent.

**Why Zettelkasten works for me:**
- **Atomic notes** - One idea per note, easy to link and reuse
- **Networked thinking** - Knowledge grows through connections, not folders
- **Future-proof** - Plain markdown means my notes outlive any app

I also build my own Obsidian plugins and tools to optimize my workflow - because why stop at ricing the desktop when you can rice your second brain too?

---

## Learning Approach

I use **AI tools** as a learning partner to understand new concepts faster. Not to skip the work, but to **get better at it** - combining self-teaching with modern tools.

## Why Codeberg?

**Open source deserves an open-source home.** Switching from GitHub to Codeberg was the logical step - a platform that lives the values it hosts.

## Ricing Journey

```
Distros:   Ubuntu > Mint > Fedora > Arch > EndeavourOS > Arch > NixOS
Display:   X11 > Wayland (no turning back)
WM:        i3wm > Hyprland > Niri > Hyprland (but I keep all three)
```

### My Ricing Philosophy

> The goal isn't to finish - it's to keep improving.

I don't believe in "one perfect setup". I maintain configs for **i3**, **Hyprland**, and **Niri** because each has its strengths. Some days I want tiling predictability, other days I want smooth animations. The beauty of NixOS is that switching between them is just a rebuild away.

**What ricing means to me:**
- **Functionality first** - A pretty desktop that slows me down is useless
- **Reproducibility** - My entire setup lives in git; one command rebuilds everything
- **Experimentation** - Try everything, keep what works, document what doesn't
- **Community** - Sharing configs and learning from others on r/unixporn and beyond
